# EnPani Search

A simple semantic search app for [EnPani episodes](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhrdHlkOIj-W8D_Rj76-4Z0J9d0cjoIuI) for anyone looking to learn more from Sri U Ve Velukkudi Krishnan Swamy's podcast. 
This was attempted as a Proof Of Concept so episodes before 1245 and after 3506 are not searchable yet.

Author does not own or claim any credit for any of the EnPani content.
This app is powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Milvus](https://milvus.io/).

### Prerequisites

Please ensure you have Python 3.x installed. This project was tested with Python 3.11 but lower versions may be compatible too.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Install dependencies in a python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate        # on Windows
source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Add the following 3 variables into the `.env` file in this project root directory.

```text
MILVUS_DB_PATH="enpani.db"
RETURN_K_RESULTS=10
DB_COLLECTION_NAME="demo_collection_on_en_text"
```
options for `DB_COLLECTION_NAME` are:
* demo_collection_on_en_text (works best for now)
  * embeddings from only english captions
* demo_collection_on_title
  * embeddings from title
* demo_collection
  * embeddings from title + all video captions available

These collections have embedded different information about each episode into a dense vector to be used for semantic search.


## Usage

Activate the venv from the installation step and run the following command. Open this [link](http://localhost:8501) on your browser (safari does not work as of writing)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Please note: 
Upon the first startup of the app, the `load_model` method pulls the [bge_m3 model](https://milvus.io/docs/embed-with-bgm-m3.md) and can take *up to an hour* depending on internet speed. Subsequent startups can complete in less than a minute.

## Enhancements

Possible future enhancements include:
* displaying English title and/or other useful metadata for each episode in search results
* improving quality of results when searching with episode number
* programmatically evaluating the quality of search results
* exploring other embedding models for better performance with Tamil + English
